## Usage

### Custom Field Mode

- Supports editing and saving flag selections

- Shows current entry information and flag assignments
- Displays available flags and variations
- Read-only view of flag data (no editing capabilities)

## Troubleshooting

### Field Appears as "Display Only"

If the custom field appears as display-only instead of allowing selection:

1. **Check App Installation**: Ensure the app is properly installed in your Contentstack organization
2. **Verify Content Type Setup**: Make sure the custom field is added to your content type
3. **Check Entry Context**: Ensure you're editing an entry (not just viewing)
4. **Refresh the Page**: Try refreshing the entry editor
5. **Check Console**: Open browser developer tools and check for error messages
6. **Verify App Configuration**: Check that the app is configured with valid LaunchDarkly credentials

### Common Issues

- **"Custom Field Context Not Available"**: The app is not being loaded in the right context. Make sure it's added as a custom field to a content type.
- **"Field not found"**: The SDK is not properly initialized. Try refreshing the page.
- **"API connection failed"**: Check your LaunchDarkly API credentials and network connectivity.
- **Sidebar Widget not showing**: Ensure the sidebar widget is added to your content type's sidebar configuration.

### Debug Mode

The app includes extensive debugging information. To access it:

1. Open the custom field or sidebar widget in an entry
2. Look for the "ðŸ§ª Debug Info" section
3. Expand it to see detailed status information
4. Use the "Test Field" button to verify field functionality (Custom Field mode only)
